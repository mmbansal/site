            <center><h1>IDEOLOGY BEHIND HOMOEO-SOLUTIONS</h1></center><br><br>
            <p>
Homoeo-Solutions is an endeavor of Dr Shweta Bansal in collaboration with AID-NCR (Association for India Development, an NGO).
It is a humble attempt to bring about awareness regarding homoeopathy and at the same time provide free consultation to patients who want to experience the goodness of homoeopathy, but cannot afford expensive consultation fee, or  do not have access to homoeopathic care provider. Thus homoeosolutions will help in alleviating their sufferings at a minimal cost and that too sitting at home.
The world in which we live, our society is formed and shaped by our deeds and actions. We believe that it is only us who can make or break it. Our belief in the following saying is firm.
The gift of good health is the best gift one can give back to the society. Nothing can give more satisfaction than the fact that our actions have improved someones quality of life and brought a smile to someones lips.
It is this philosophy which led us along this path and paved the way for HOMOEO-SOLUTIONS.

            Dr Shweta Bansal is a confident, empathetic, conscientious and forthright doctor who is not only concerned with the patient&#39s disease but also in the individual as a whole.
Dr Bansal&#39s focus has always been as much on curing the disease as on preventing it. She follows the age old adage &#34An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#34 and has been a promoter of healthy eating and living habits. 
As a child, during her growing up years she was always fascinated by these magical white pills which could cure all her ailments. As she delved deeper her interest grew. She made the very same homoeopathy her profession. She considers herself as one of the lucky few who could relaise their childhood dream.
Dr Bansal completed her B.H.M.S. from one of the most prestigious institutions for homoeopathy in India, Nehru Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital. She completed her P.G. Diploma in Clinical Research with flying colors in 2010.
Soon after completion of internship she was associated with the world&#39s largest chain of Homoeopathic Clinics, where she further cured and helped a large number of patients with her skills.
For Dr Shweta Philanthropy was not just an idea but a way of life. Her upbringing instilled the belief in her that even the minutest and tiniest effort can make an ocean of difference.
Homoeo-Solutions is a brain child of Dr Shweta Bansal and the idea was conceived in 2011.It was a unique opportunity to combine both her passion and dream into one. It was made possible with financial help through Intel corp and in collaboration with Aid-NCR.
